# My _vimrc

## Introduction

This is my vimrc file, backed up on GitHub for safekeeping.

I named it \_vimrc instead of .vimrc because I use this configuration file
under Windows too. Vim on other platforms can use \_vimrc without any
problems, so this name is portable.

## Plugins Needed

This vimrc uses Vundle to pull in other plugins, so follow the instructions at
<https://github.com/gmarik/vundle> for initial installation.

In addition, I use some custom NERDTree plugins from
<https://github.com/mortonfox/nerdtree-iterm>
