# My _vimrc

## Introduction

This is my vimrc file, backed up on GitHub for safekeeping.

I named it ``_vimrc`` instead of ``.vimrc`` because I use this configuration
file under Windows too. Vim on other platforms can use ``_vimrc`` without any
problems, so this name is portable.

## Plugins Needed

This vimrc uses [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to pull in
other plugins. It should auto-install vim-plug, but in case it doesn't, check
vim-plug's README for instructions.
